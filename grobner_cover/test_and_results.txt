Test Summary and Results: Grobner Cover Computation
======================================================

This file documents the results of multiple experiments conducted  
using the Grobner Cover computation pipeline.

------------------------------------------------------
1. Latest Experiment (3 Parameters)
------------------------------------------------------

• Runtime: ~36 hours  
• Peak Memory Usage: ~180 GB  
• Result: Unexpected system reset before completion.

Although the program was terminated due to a system reset, it is  
important to note that **given sufficient memory and time, a result  
will eventually be found**. This is guaranteed by the algorithm  
implemented in `grobcov.lib`, which is based on the  
**Grobner Cover algorithm by Montes (1999)** — an algorithm known  
to terminate.

It’s likely that the reset was unrelated to memory limits, since the  
`limits_stats.py` monitor was running throughout. However, the tested  
version of the code **did not include a file-write command**, meaning  
the result may have been lost even if it had completed successfully.  
While this is speculative, it cannot be ruled out.

2. Performance Insights
------------------------------------------------------

From the 3-parameter case onward, the **conditions that define each  
Grobner basis region become equation systems themselves**, which in  
my opinion is the main reason for the dramatic increase in computation  
time compared to the simpler 2-parameter case that can be solved  
quickly and returns linear conditions.

Because of this, **after a result is found there would be a need to  
solve all the conditions for fast access**, though that would be quite  
simple since all of them are just polynomial equation systems.

3. Results
------------------------------------------------------

• **2 Parameters:**  
  Example results available in `grobner_cover_2_parameters.json`

• **3 Parameters:**  
  Not successfully completed.  
  Ran for 36 hours, used 180 GB of memory. Unexpected system reset  
  occurred before result was saved.  
  Root cause undetermined, likely not memory exhaustion.

• **>3 Parameters:**  
  Untested. Expected to require even more memory and time.
